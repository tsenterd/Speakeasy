<h1> About the Game </h1>


<p> The speakeasy language teaching game was inspired by Google releasing their Voice API.

The authors wanted to create something that utilised voice recognition, as they saw this as a new and interesting technology that will be emerging soon.

After some research, the creators found out that the only way to use the Google Voice API was with python, and python was off limits.

After even more research, we decided to use  the sphinx code created by Cornell University students, and we built a game around that.

The result, speakeasy, a maze game that will twist your tongue, with lots of fun, and teach you English.</p>
